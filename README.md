## Introduction

This repository provides examples of applying Item Response Theory to estimate the latent level of member's engagement.  We create two overall measures of activity - a _non-investment activity index_ and an _investment activity index_ - that might be respectively interpreted as proxies for the overall level of engagement and interest in superannuation in general, and investment decisions more specifically.  Please refer to the Technical Appendix of _Overview of a Study of Investment Switching Activity by Members of Aware Super_ for more information.

The package `mirt` is required to estimate the latent activity indices. The package `tidyverse` is not needed for the estimation but is used in summarising and visualising the results.
